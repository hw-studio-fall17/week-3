# CSS: Styling your website

#### Your mission:
1. Change the `background-color` of the body to a pretty [hex color](https://www.google.com/search?q=hex+color+picker&oq=hex+color+picker&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3883j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
2. Change the color of the heading. 
3. Add a border that is 5px thick around your heading. You choose the color.
4. Center the header.
5. Add a dotted border around the `<ul>`. You choose the color!
6. Make the width of your image 200px.
7. Change the font of the `<p>` tag. 
8. Make your `<p>` tag italicized. Stuck?? Try googling: "how to italicize css"

#### Extensions
1. Change the `background-color` of your heading. Set it to be a `rgba()` color instead of a hex color code. Confused? Check out this [link](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_colors.asp). `rgba()` creates colors that are transparent.
2. Add `padding: 50px;` to your heading. What did that do?
3. Add `margin: 100px` to your heading. What did that do?
4. Add a `border-radius` to your heading to make the edges curved. Not sure what that means? GOOGLE IT!
5. Take a look at this [link](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.asp). Try to add a border around your image that only appears when your mouse hovers over it.
6. Try to center everything on your webpage. 
    - This can be harder than it seems! You'll find a big challenge in CSS is trying to position items where you want them. Don't forget! Google is your friend!
    - Hint: add widths to most of your items
